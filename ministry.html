    <h1>Ministries</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Current Ministries</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Youth - We desire the youth of our church to know God deeply.  We have youth group on Friday nights and youth Sunday school after worship on Sundays.  Middle school and high school students are welcome to join.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Married/Young Families -  This is an area of focus for our English Ministry. Upon reaching adulthood, today's American-Born Chinese (ABCs) often find the church has no place for them to worship and serve.  Caught between two worlds, they neither fit in mainstream Anglo churches nor in traditional OBC-oriented Chinese churches.  Many are at risk of leaving the church -  and possibly God altogether. We provide a place for these people to connect, worship and serve with other Chinese- and Asian-American families and couple.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Children's Ministry - Combined with the Chinese side.  The children have their own Sunday school as well as Friday night programs.  Once a month, we have a Children's Worship Service.  We also have a nursery for babies and new mothers.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Intercultural Marriages - With the shrinking of the globe and the increase in connecting people via the internet, it is becoming common to find marriages that cross cultures.  These marriages pose unique challenges, and we strive to encourage these couples with the heart to mentor and serve them.</li> 
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Married/Young Families</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This is both an AMAZING yet STRESSFUL season of life.  There are amazing joys... falling in love, weddings, birth of babies, kids going off to kindergarten, buying your first house.  Yet the pressures of life and work, parenting and marriage, school and homework, piano lessons and soccer, loans and finances, extended family and in-laws leave us with our hands more than full.  It can all seem very overwhelming at times!</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the midst of all this, how do we have time for our walk with God and properly invest into our spouse? How do we maintain our personal standards of excellence when we're in the perpetual state of letting things slide and feeling guilty about it?</p>
    <br>
    <p>If this sounds like you, come join us as we walk this journey together.  Our goal is to offer a safe and nurturing place where authentic conversations happen, where we can be "real" in our day-to-day struggles and triumphs.  In doing so, we'll build rich friendships, enjoy deep fellowship, chew through the Word of God, and enjoy good food.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Youth Group</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Motivated by God's love and empowered by the Holy Spirit, we seek to be a Biblically-based Youth Group that impacts our peers, our church, our community, and the world in ways that Jesus would.</p>
