  <p>Yuh, it's ya boi Ben. Back atcha, baby! This is the new website I'm creating due to complications (I guess you could call it the I kinda don't want to accidently mess up the official CECV church website with my experimentations, so I'm keeping them in here) with the old website. Also, I get to now use the software of my choice, which is epic. Also, I honestly think it looks way better than the rustic look of the old church website. idk, but this is my playground now, and if you dare mess it up, I will publically behead your childhood stuffed animal. Good day.</p>
