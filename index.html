        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>We're building a family-friendly community where Chinese and Asian-Americans can build friendships, share life, and raise healthy kids.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>As a Bible-believing Christian church, we'll explore what it means to "seek first the Kingdom of God" through the cultural lens of recovering Tiger Cubs finding our way in a performance-driven world.</p>  
        <br>
        <p>Through our experiences, we've noticed that many Asian-Americans -- even those who've lived all their lives in America -- have a tough time finding a spiritual home in mainline Anglo churches.  To fill this gap, we're shaping CECV to be a place where folks like us can "geek out" on God, grace, and good Asian food.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If this sounds like you, join us for Sunday worship at 10am at our church, centrally located in Vancouver near Mill Plain and I-205.  Or contact Pastor Paul to plug directly into a small group.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a young ministry seeking to transform Clark County for Jesus Christ, we're on the lookout for co-workers, musicians and prayer warriors to join our team.</p>
