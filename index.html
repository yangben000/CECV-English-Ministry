                As a Bible-believing Christian church, we'll explore what it means to "seek first the Kingdom of God" through the cultural lens of recovering Tiger Cubs finding our way in a performance-driven world.
                <br><br>
                Through our experiences, we've noticed that many Asian-Americans -- even those who've lived all their lives in America -- have a tough time finding a spiritual home in mainline Anglo churches. To fill this gap, we're shaping CECV to be a place where folks like us can "geek out" on God, grace, and good Asian food.
                <br><br>
                As a young ministry seeking to transform Clark County for Jesus Christ, we're on the lookout for co-workers, musicians and prayer warriors to join our team.
